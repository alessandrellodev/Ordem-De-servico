ordem de serviÃ§o
Excited to share my third learning project: building a Service Order (Ordem de ServiÃ§o) database using MySQL Workbench! ðŸš€

In this project, I designed a relational database that manages the full cycle of service requests. Hereâ€™s how it works:

    Clients register their information and request services.

    Each request (Pedido) includes details like the type of service, description, and request date.

    Requests are analyzed by a responsible team member (Responsavel) through an analysis step, ensuring every request is reviewed.

    Once approved, a Service Order is generated, tracking the status and progress of each job.

This project helped me understand how to map real business processes into a database structure, connecting clients, requests, analysis, and service orders in a clear workflow. Step by step, Iâ€™m getting more confident with SQL and data modeling!
